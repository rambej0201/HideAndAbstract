Java OOPs Concept Abstraction: The process of highliting the set of services and hiding implementations is called Abstraction

* We can achieve abstraction by using abstract class concept and interface concept
* Abstract method contains method declaration but not method implementation. Each & every abstract method must end with terminator/semicolon
* To represent a specific method as an abstract method use modifier Abstract

Abstract Class: Abstract class also known as helper class
Defining Abstract Class: Abstract class may or may not abstract method but it is not possible to declare an object through abstract class

* If a class contains at least one abstract method and class representation with Abstract modifier is also called Abstract class
* Through abstract class we can not declare an object
* It is not possible to declare/create an object through an abstract class
* We can prevent object creation through Abstract modifier

Purpose of Abstract Modifier:
1. Abstract modifier is applicable for method and class
2. Abstract modifier usually represents particular method is an abstract method and particular class is an abstract class.
